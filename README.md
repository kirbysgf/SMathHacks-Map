# SMathHacks-Map

I've created an interactive dashboard using Tableau for the eco-equality sector in SmathHacks!

I wanted to see if there was any relationship between race and environmental factors such as green spaces and healthy food options.
There is environmental racism in access to natural resources due to redlining and socioeconomic factors. I made this because the first step is always awareness!

I didn't have much code because I worked in Tableau and Google Sheets to organize my data. I have linked the datasets I used in this repository.
